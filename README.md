# Natural Disasters and Carbon Stocks in Forest.

## Description
This project visualizes the Carbon stocks in Fortest and Disasters across Countries. It was 
developed during my studies of "Visualization and Visual Data Analysis" at the University of Vienna.
The dashboard is designed to help climate activists from the WWF in the following three tasks:

• Task 1: Investigating the relative impact of climate change on natural habitats worldwide, focusing on
natural disasters and forest cover.

• Task 2: Identifying areas with the largest carbon stocks in forests to prioritize protective actions.

• Task 3: Locating regions with the most significant relative changes in forestation to identify fast-
changing environments where immediate intervention might yield the greatest benefits.

The dashboard is also published as git hub page:
